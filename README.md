Reproducibility of [A Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226)

This project aims to reproduce and validate the watermarking algorithm outlined in the paper 'A Watermark for Large Language Models'.
A thorough analysis of the algorithm is conducted by investigating the hyperparameters and quality of text generation and detection.
